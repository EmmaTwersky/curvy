### The rules of the game.
The rules of curvy are simple. Given a board with x number of pieces (shaped as hexagons originally and in the simplest version of my game, squares), the goal is to rotate the game peices so that all pathways on the board are complete and correct. This is defined as when all edges of paths math up with another pathway edge of the same color.
