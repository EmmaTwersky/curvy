A rendition of the game 'Curvy' to fulfill our CODA Unit 1 game assignment
---------------------
### Technologies used.
To complete this project, I used the languages Javascript, CSS and HTML, all on Atom and hosted by Github.

### Your process/approach.
My process was to initially wireframe and create user stories, as well as look at the components this game would need. I then created psuedo-code outlining each technology and how it would be used. Next, I began by figuring out creating the game board. This hexagonal design took a majority of my Monday and Tuesday. To create the interlocking grid of figures, I used an unordered list of items. I then rendered the 39 images and formatted them to fill the tiles. I then began on looking at rotating game pieces and formatting the game. Finally, I worked on simplifying my code to be dry, adding comments and looking forward and further features. I specifically focused on the features which were easily completed, and tackled a button to shuffle and create a new game and reset buttons. This appraoch was heavily streamlined by my initial user stories and Trello board, as well as the wireframing and understanding of features vital versus "fun" to complete the game.

I also approached creating a secondary game of a Settlers of Catan board. This process was very different from the above.

### Future features
In the future, this game will include levels of difficulty and customization, as well as a potential version to play against a computer and keep score as the number of edges successfully matched up in each round or turn. I would also love to be able to render my own games individually on the screen, instead of relying on predetermined images and renderings.

### Any bugs
There are no current bugs in my repositories. Unfortunately the current rending of the puzzle seems mostly unscalable at least as coded.

### Your biggest wins and challenges.
My biggest win was creating my own interlocking grid of interactive hexagons. My largest challenge was also my biggest win, the hexagonal game board.

### The game you chose.
I chose the game "curvy." Additional versions and descriptions can be seen here:

+ http://entanglement.gopherwoodstudios.com/ (a similar version of the game I am building)

### The rules of the game.
The rules of curvy are simple. Given a board with x number of pieces (shaped as hexagons originally and in the simplest version of my game, squares), the goal is to rotate the game pieces so that all pathways on the board are complete and correct. This is defined as when all edges of paths math up with another pathway edge of the same color.

### Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up).
User stories and Trello board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/tuQTlqE6/unit-1-project-curvy-game
Wireframes can be found in an additional file in this repository.
